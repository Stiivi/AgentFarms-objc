Threads

Simulation is run in separate thread. Each time user requests to run a
simulation for several steps, new thread is detached, set up and run. For
simulation thread a simulation evnironment is set. All objects from simulation
can refer to the environment if they need to:

    - get an object prototype
    - get named object
    - register object with name
    
Simulator is using environment for storing object references during simulation.
