Simulation
----------

See model template in Models/Template

You have to implement following method in each simulation root object:
    - (void)step

You may implement following methods to be able to save simulation state:
    - (void)encodeWithCoder:(NSCoder *)aCoder
    - (id)initWithCoder:(NSCoder *)aDecoder

You may implement:
    - (void)initWithPrototype:(AFObjectPrototype *)prototype;
    - (void)awakeWithPrototype:(AFObjectPrototype *)prototype;

You write simulation body in method 'step'.

To be able to save and restore simulation state, methods 'encodeWithCoder:'
and 'initWithCoder:' have to be implemented. This is also needed for transfering 
simulation to another simulator.


To get simulation evnironment use [self environment] in any simulation object.

Note: there should be only one simulation running per thread.
